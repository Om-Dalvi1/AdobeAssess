# AdobeAssess
Our product is a modern and interactive website using javascript that takes input from the user about the home owners information such as gross monthly income, various payments, loan amounts they may have and credit score and calculates whether they are eligible to buy a house. We accomplish this by utilizing python data frames to input the large amount of data and decide whether the inputted information is acceptable. It then will output to a flask server which is run using HTML, CSS and javascript. To get the information between the server and python, we used flask and ajax so the variables could be communicated between the client and the server. The website displays a hand drawn background and a custom cursor that allows the user to swiftly navigate through the website.
